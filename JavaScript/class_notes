JavaScript:
-----------
    - JavaScript is the scripting language.

    - By using JavaScript we make the web pages
      as Dynamic Interactive web pages.


Variables in JavaScript:
------------------------

    - Variables in JavaScript are used to
      store the data.

    - we can declare the Variables by using  
      "var" keyword.

    - by using Variables we can store all
      categories of data.


Ex.

var data = 100;

var data = "Data From DataBase....!";

var data=true;

var data = {"sub_one":"AngularJS",
            "sub_two":"NodeJS",
            "sub_three":"MongoDB"};

var data = new Student();



Displaying the Data on Browser Console:
---------------------------------------
console.log("Welcome to JavaScript");


Displaying the Data on Web Page:
--------------------------------
document.write("Welcome to JavaScript");


Functions in JavaScript:
------------------------
  - Functions are used to implement
    the Business logic.

  - we can create the functions by using
    "function" keyword.

  - By using functions we can reuse the 
    Business Logic.    

  - we have two types of functions

    1. Named Functions.

    2. Anonymous Functions.


Named Functions:
----------------
  - the functions with name called as
    Named functions.

Syntax.

  //function defination.
  function fun_name(){
    //Business Logic
  }

  //calling the function.
  fun_name();


Anonymous functions:
--------------------
- the functions with out name called
  as Anonymous functions.

- Anonymous functions are more secured
  compared to named functions.

- Anonymous functions utilizes the memory
  efficiently.     

Syntax:
-------
  var x = function(){
    //Logic Goes Here
  };

  x();

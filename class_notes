AngularJS.

	- AngularJS is a Clinet Side JavaScript Framework.

	- AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

		M - Model

		V - View

		C - Controller

	- By using AngularJS we can reduce the burden on the server by implementing
	  business components at client side.

	- we are missing the secuirity by angularjs.

	- we can provide the communication between angularjs to programming languages like
      java, dotnet,php....

    - in genaral we will develop the secured code by using programming languages.

    	Ex.

    		payment gateways
    		paypal services
    		DB Configurations
    		user details

    - we can implement the "unsecured region" by using angularjs , angular4,reactsjs....


    - angularjs supports the "two way data binding"
    	Automatic Data syncronization between "model and view" with the supervision of controller called as Two way data binding.


    - in the above diagram we have the following server calls.

    	1. http get request

    	2. http delete request

    	3. async call

    - as a programming languages developer we must make above three server calls to meet application requirement.

    - as a angularjs / angular4 developer we can only two server calls to meet application requirement because of two way data binding.

    - two way data binding reduces the burden on the server.

    - by using angularjs we can work with the HTML DOM directly.

    - DOM Stands for Document Object Model


bower:
    - bower is a automation tool used to download the dependencies to develop web application.
    - bower based on node platform

installation of bower.
---------------------
> npm install -g bower


bower components
----------------
1.bower.json
2. .bowerrc



Angular Applications:

1. static angular application
2. dynamic angular application


static angular application:

    - if view won't interacts with the controller for dynamic data then such type of application
      called as static angular application.



steps to create the static angular application:
-----------------------------------------------

step 1:
    download angular by using bower


step 2:
     create the view



dynamic angular application
---------------------------
    - if view interacts with controller for dynamic data then such type of angular application
      called as dynamic angular application.


steps to create the dynamic angular applications:
-------------------------------------------------

step 1:
    download angular by using bower

step 2:
    load angular framework

step 3:
    declare the logical name for the web application
    ng-app="app"

step 4:
     declare the controller

     <div ng-controller="ctrl">

     </div>


step 5.
     add the dependencies to angular application.

    var app = angular.module("app",[]);


Step 6.

    implement the controller.

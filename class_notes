What is AngularJS.
      - AngularJS is the JavaScript MVC Framework.
      - AngularJS Have a so many predefined Modules, As a Angular Developer we can reuse
        the Predefined Modules.

      Ex.
            1. ngAnimate.
                    - used to develop the Animations in Angular Applications.

            2. ngMessages.
                    - used to perform the client side form validations.

            3.ngStorage.
                    - used to work with the storages.
                    - we have two types of storages.
                            1.localStorage
                            2.sessionStorage

            4.ngRoute
                    - used to implement the Routing in SPA

            5.ui.router
                    - used to implement the Routing in SPA
                    - it is a 3rd party module
                    - This Module Have so many advantages Compared to ngRoute Module.


Ex.

index.html
-
    <html ng-app="app">

        //Support the Animations
        //Supports the SPA (ui.router)
        //Form Validations
        //Storages

        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
        <script>
            var app = angular.module("app",["ngAnimate","ui.router","ngStorage","ngMessage"]);
        </script>
    </html>

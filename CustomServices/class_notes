Service
-------
    - services in angularjs, used to share the common business logic to multiple number of controllers.

    - we have two types of services.
        1. predefined services
        2. custom services.

predefined services:
    - the services given by angular framework called as predefined services.

Ex.
    1.$http

    2.$q

    3.$interval

    4.$timeout

    5.$location


custom services:
---------------
    - the services developed by developer based on application requirement called as custom services.
    - in angularjs, we can create the custom services by using following functions
        1. factory()
        2. provider()
        3. service()
        4. value()
        5. constant()

creating the custom service by using factory()
----------------------------------------------

app.factory("my_service",my_service);
function my_service(){
    return "Data From DataBase....";
}


app.controller("ctrl_one",ctrl_one);
function ctrl_one($scope,my_service){
    $scope.var_one = my_service;
}

app.controller("ctrl_two",ctrl_two);
function ctrl_two($scope,my_service){
    $scope.var_two = my_service;
}

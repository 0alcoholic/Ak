Karma with Jasmine:
-------------------

    - We have Two Types Of Testings.

        1. Manual Testing
            [Now a days no body using Manual Testing]

        2. Automation Testing.
            [Now a days all most all the projects using Automation Testing]

    - Karma is the Testing Framework used to perform Automation Testing on UI Applications

        Ex.
            AngularJS
            Angular4
            reactJS
            NodeJS
                --
                --
                --

     - Automation Testing categorized into 3 types.

     1. unit testing

     2. integration testing

     3. end to end testing.



1. unit testing
---------------
    - checking the perticular functionality with dummy scenarios called as unit testing.


2. integration testing
----------------------
    - checking the perticular functionality with real scenarios called as integration testing.

3. end to end testing:
---------------------
    - checking whole application with different end points (api points, physical connections) called as
      end to end testing.

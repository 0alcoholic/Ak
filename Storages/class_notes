Angular Storages:

    - AngularJS supports two types of browser storages.

        1. local storage

        2. session storage

local storage:

    - local storage is a client side storage , and will be destroy explicitly
      by developer.

session storage:

    - when ever we close the browser or opens the new tab automatically
      data will be lost from session storage.


    - ngStorage is the predefined module and used to work with the storages.

    - ngStorage module provides following predefined objects

        1. $localStorage

        2. $sessionStorage

    - in general we will store data in the form of a "key&value" pairs.


Ex.

    //local storage

    $localStorage.key1 = {'uname':'admin','upwd':'admin'};
        //storing the data into local storage
        // where "key1" is the 'key' to persist the data in local storage



    var obj = $localStorage.key1;  //reading the data from local storage

    console.log(obj.uname);   //admin
    console.log(obj.upwd);    //admin



    delete $localStorage.key1;    //deleting the data from local storage



    //session storage

        $sessionStorage.key1 = {'uname':'admin','upwd':'admin'};
            //storing the data into session storage
            // where "key1" is the 'key' to persist the data in session storage



        var obj = $sessionStorage.key1;  //reading the data from session storage

        console.log(obj.uname);   //admin
        console.log(obj.upwd);    //admin



        delete $sessionStorage.key1;    //deleting the data from session storage

Storages:

    - AngularJS supports following client side storages.

    1. local storage.

    2. session storage.

    local storage:
        - as a developer we must delete the local storage explicitly.

    session storage:
        - when ever we close the browser / opens the new tab automatically
          we will lost the data from session storage.


    - ngStorage is the predefined module used to work with the Storages.

    - ngStorage module will provide the following predefined objects.

        1. $localStorage

        2. $sessionStorage



    - "$localStorage" is the predefined object used to work with the local storage.

    - "$sessionStorage" is the predefined object used to work with the session storage.

    - in general we will store the data in the form of a "key&value" pairs.

    - "ngstorage" is the bower key used to download the "ngStorage" Module
       dependency file.

Ex.
    local storage
    -------------

    $localStorage.class_app = {"uname":"admin","upwd":"admin"}; //storing the data into local storage
                    (key)       (value)


    var obj = $localStorage.class_app; //reading the data from local storage
    console.log(obj.uname); //admin
    console.log(obj.upwd);  //admin



    delete $localStorage.class_app; //delete the data from local storage.



    session storage
    -------------

    $sessionStorage.class_app = {"uname":"admin","upwd":"admin"}; //storing the data into session storage
                    (key)       (value)


    var obj = $sessionStorage.class_app; //reading the data from session storage
    console.log(obj.uname); //admin
    console.log(obj.upwd);  //admin


    delete $sessionStorage.class_app; //delete the data from session storage.

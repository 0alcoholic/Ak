Storages:

    - we have two types of client side storages.

        1. localStorage
        2. sessionStorage

    localStorage: As a developer we must delete the localStorage.

    sessionStorage : when ever we "close the browser" , "opens the new tab in browser" , automatically
                     we lost the data from sessionStorage.

    - ngStorage is the predefined module used to work with the Storages.

    - ngStorage module provides the following predefined objects.

        1. $localStorage
        2. $sessionStorage

    $localStorage : this object used to work with the local storage.

    $sessionStorage : this object used to work with the session storage.


    - we can store the data in the form of a "key&value" pairs.


Ex.

        $localStorage.login = {"uname":"admin","upwd":"admin"};  //storing the data into localStorage
                      (key)           (value)

        var obj = $localStorage.login;                          //reading the data from localStorage
        console.log(obj.uname+"..."+obj.upwd);

        delete $localStorage.login;                             //deleting from localStorage.



                    *******************************
        $sessionStorage.login = {"uname":"admin","upwd":"admin"};      //storing the data into sessionStorage
                              (key)           (value)

        var obj = $sessionStorage.login;                              //reading the data from sessionStorage
        console.log(obj.uname+"..."+obj.upwd);

        delete $sessionStorage.login;                                 //deleting from sessionStorage.

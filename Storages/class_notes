-AngularJS Supports the Two Types Of Storages.

    1.localStorage

    2.sessionStorage

- ngStorage is the Predefined Module , used to work with the Storages.

- $localStorage , $sessionStorage are the Predefined Objects in ngStorage Module.

- $localStorage used to work with the localStorage.

- $sessionStorage used to work with the sessionStorage.


localStorage.
    As a developer we must delete the localStorage explicitely.


sessionStorage.
    When ever we close the browser , automatically data will be erased from sessionStorage.


- We Can Store the Data in the Form of a "key & value" pairs


var data = {"u_name":"admin" , "u_pwd":"admin"};

$localStorage.mini_project = data;  // Storing the Data in LocalStorage.

var data  = $localStorage.mini_project; // Retriving from local Storage.

delete $localStorage.mini_project;      // Deleting from local Storage.


------------------------------------------

$sessionStorage.mini_project = data;  // Storing the Data in sessionStorage.

var data  = $sessionStorage.mini_project; // Retriving from session Storage.

delete $sessionStorage.mini_project;      // Deleting from session Storage.

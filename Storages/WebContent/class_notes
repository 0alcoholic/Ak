localStorage:
-------------

$localStorage.class = {'id':1,'token':12345}; 
	//storing the data into local storage


var obj = $localStorage.class;
console.log(obj.id+"..."+obj.token); //reading the data from local storage


delete $localStorage.class;  // deleting the data from localStorage


sessionStorage:
-------------

$sessionStorage.class = {'id':1,'token':12345}; 
	//storing the data into session storage


var obj = $sessionStorage.class;
console.log(obj.id+"..."+obj.token); //reading the data from session storage


delete $sessionStorage.class;  // deleting the data from sessionStorage

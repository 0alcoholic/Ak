Introduction.

    - AngularJS is a JavaScript MVC Framework.

    - M - Model (JavaScript Variables)

      V - View  (HTML / HTML5)

      C - Controller (JavaScript Functions)


Advantages Of AngularJS.

    - AngularJS Reduces the Burden on the Server by implementing the

      Business Components At Client Side By Using MVC.


Drawbacks of AngularJS.
-

    - Secuirity.


Environmental Setup.

    - The Softwares Required to develop Angular Application

      called as Environmental Setup.

1.bower.

    - Bower is a Automation tool used to download the

      Required Resources to Develop Web Application.

    - Bower is the Plugin Provided by NodeJS.

bower components.

1.bower.json

2..bowerrc.json


bower.json
-
    used to write the required resources to develop web application.
{

    "dependencies":{
        "angular" : "~1.6.0",
        "bootstrap": "~3.3.6"
    }

}

.bowerrc.json
-
    used to indicate the path for resources.
{
    "directory":"bower_components"
}



Software Installation.

1.Download and Install the NodeJS.

    website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

    file    : node-v6.10.1-x64.msi


2.Download and Install the GIT.

    website : https://git-scm.com/download/win

    file    : Git-2.12.1-64-bit.exe



3.Download WebStrom IDE.

    website : https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=windows

    file name : WebStrom-2017.1.exe

4. Add the bower plugin

    Open the Terminal in WebStrom (Alt+F12)

    Execute the Following Node Command

        npm install -g bower

Angular Applications.

        - By using AngularJS We Can Create Two Types Of Angular Applications.

1.Static Angular Application

2.Dynamic Angular Application

Static Angular Application.

    - View won't interacts with controller for dynamic data

      called as Static Angular Application.

Steps to Create the Static Angular Application.


Step 1.

    download angular by using bower.


Step 2.

    Create View.

 Ex.
     index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html ng-app>
    <input type="number" ng-model="model_one">
    <input type="number" ng-model="model_two">
    <h1 style="color:red" ng-bind="model_one+model_two"></h1>
    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>


Dynamic Angular Application.

    - If view interacting with the controller for dynamic data,
      then such type of Angular Application called as Dynamic Angular Application.

  Steps to Create the Dynamic Angular Application.

  1.Load the Angular Framework.

  2.Declare the logical name of Application by using ng-app directive

        [ Note . if our application is dynamic , we must give logical name of application

          by using ng-app directive.]

  3.Declare the controller by using 'ng-controller' directive.

  4.Instantiate the Module.

  5.Implement the controller.

--------------------------------------
DynamicAngularApplication

    index.html

    app.js

    controllers

        ctrl.js
----------------------------------------


Directives.

    - Directives will enhance HTML Capabilities.

    - We Have Two Types Of Directives.

        1.Predefined Directives.

        2.Custom Directives.

Predefined Directives.

    - The Directives Given by the Framework called as Predefined Directives.

1.ng-app

       - Angular Framework starts the execution from ng-app directive.

       - we can logical name for dynamic application by using ng-app directive.

       Ex.

        ng-app = "myApp"

            where myApp is the logical name of web application.

        - we can have only one ng-app per application.

        - Framework automatically identifies the ng-app directive

          and Starts the Execution , called as AutoBootstrap.

        - Running the Angular Application Forcefully without

          ng-app called as Manual Bootstrap.

Introduction.
    - AngularJS is a client side javascript MVC Framework.

    - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model (javaScript Variables)
        V - View  (HTML / HTML5)
        C - Controller (JavaScript Functions)

    - AngularJS have a so many predefined Modules ,
      as a AngularJS Developer we can use the predefined Modules.

      1.ngMessages
      2.ngAnimate
      3.ngStorage
      4.ngRoute
      5.ui.router

      ngMessages.

        - used to handle the client side validations.

      ngAnimate.

        - used to develop the Animations/

      ngStorage.

        - used to work with the Storages.

            1.localStorage

            2.sessionStorage

      ngRoute.

        - used to Achieve the Routing in Single Page Applications.

        - ngRoute is the Native Module.

        - ngRoute Have So many limitations


      ui.router.

        - used to Achieve the Routings in Single Page Applications.

        - ui.router module the 3 rd party module.

        - ui.router module have a so many advantages compared to ngRoute Module.

      Ex.

         index.html
         -
         <html ng-app="app">
              //Client Side Validations
              //Implement the Storages
              //SPA - ui.router
              //Animations
          <script
               src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/
                    angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
            <script>
                angular.module("app",["ngMessages",
                                      "ngStorage",
                                      "ui.router",
                                      "ngAnimate"]);
            </script>
         </html>


Environmental Setup.
    - The Softwares Required to develop Angular Application
      called  as Environmental Setup.


1.bower.

    bower is the automation plugin used to download the required
    resources to develop web application.

    bower is the plugin given by the NodeJS.


bower components.
-
1.bower.json
2. .bowerrc.json


Software Installations.

1.Download and Install the NodeJS.

    website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

    file    : node-v6.10.2-x64.msi


2.Download and Install the git.

    website : https://git-scm.com/downloads

    file    : Git-2.12.2.2-64-bit.exe


3. Download the WebStrom IDE.

    website : https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/
              download/#section=windows

    file    : Webstrom-2017.1.exe


4. Add the bower plugin to the WebStrom IDE.

    Open the terminal in WebStrom IDE.

        (Alt+F12)

    npm install -g bower


Angular Frame work path given by bower.
    bower_components / angular / angular.min.js

Bootstrap Framework path given by bower.
    bower_components/ bootstrap / dist / css / bootstrap.min.css

jquery library path given by bower.
    bower_components / jquery/ dist / jquery.min.js


Angular Applications.

    by using AngularJS We Can Create Two types of Angular Applications.

    1.Static Angular Application

    2.Dynamic Angular Application


Static Angular Application.

    If View won't interacts with the controller for dynamic data

    then such type angular application called as Static Angular Application.

Steps to Create the Static Angular Application.

Step 1.
    Download the Angular Framework by using bower.

Step 2.
    Load the Framework
    <script src = "bower_components / angular / angular.min.js"></script>

Step 3.
    Create the View

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>
    <input type="number" ng-model="model_one"> <br><br>
    <input type="number" ng-model="model_two">
    <h1 style="color:red" ng-bind="model_one+model_two"></h1>
    <script src = "bower_components / angular / angular.min.js"></script>
</html>

Dynamic Angular Application.

    - If View Interacting with the Controller for dynamic data
      then such type of Angular Application called as Dynamic
      Angular Application.


Step 1.
    Load the Angular Framework

Step 2.
    Declare the ng-app directive with the logical name of the web application.

Step 3.
    Declare the controller.

Step 4.
    Instantiate the Module (Getting the whole page control)
    var app = angular.module("app",[]);


Step 5.
    Implement the Controller

    app.controller("ctrl",function(){


    });


Directives.
    - used to enhance the HTML Capabilities.

    - we have two types of directives.

            Predefined Directives.

                  - The Directives Given by the Framework

    1.ng-app

        - framework starts the execution from ng-app directive.

        - we can have only one ng-app per application.

        - running angular application forcefully without ng-app called as

          manual bootstrap.


     2.ng-controller

        we can have more than one controller per web application.

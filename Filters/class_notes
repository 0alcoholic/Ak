    app.filter("reverse" , reverse);
    function reverse(){

        return function(arg1){

            var data="";
            for(var i=0;i<arg1.length;i++){
                data = arg[i]+data;

    <h1>{{200 | my_currency:"&#8364;":false}}

    app.filter("my_currency",my_currency);
    function my_currency(){
        return function(amount,symbol,position){
            if(position){
                return symbol+" "+amount;
            }else{
                return amount+" "+symbol;
            }
        }

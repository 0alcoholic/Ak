Services.
    - Services are used to share the "Common Business Logic" to the Controllers.

    - we have two types of Services.

        1. Predefined Services
        2. Custom Services

Predefined Services.

    - The Services Given By the Framework called as Predefined Services.
    1.$http
    2.$q
    3.$location
    4.$timeout
    5.$interval

Custom Services
-

    - The Services Developed by developer based on application requirement called as
      Custom Services.

    - In AngularJS We Can Create Custom Services in 5 ways.

        1.provider()
        2.factory()
        3.service()
        4.constant()
        5.value()

Creating the Custom Service by using provider().
-
app.config(config);
config.$inject=["my_serviceProvider"];
function config(my_serviceProvider){
    my_serviceProvider.db_password="new password";
}

app.provider("my_service",my_service);
function my_service(){
    this.db_password = "old password";
    this.$get = function(){
        return this.db_password;
    }
}

app.controller("ctrl_one",ctrl_one);
ctrl_one.$inject=["$scope","my_service"];
function ctrl_one($scope,my_service){
    $scope.var_one = my_service;
}

app.controller("ctrl_two",ctrl_two);
ctrl_two.$inject=["$scope","my_service"];
function ctrl_two($scope,my_service){
    $scope.var_two = my_service;
}

Creating the Custom Service by using factory.
-
function my_class(arg1){
    this.my_fun = function(){
        return arg1;
    }
}

app.factory("my_service",my_service);
function my_service(){
    return new my_class("data from db soon...").my_fun();
}


Creating the Custom Service By using constant()
-

app.constant("my_service","First Value");
app.constant("my_service","Second Value");

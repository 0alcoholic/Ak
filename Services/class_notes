Services:
    - Services are used to share the common business logic to multiple number of controllers.

    - by using services we can reuse the business logic.

    - we have two types of services

        1. predefined services

        2. custom services


predefined services:

    - the services given by the framework called as predefined services.

Ex.
    $http

    $q

    $timeout

    $interval

    $location

custom services:

    - creating our own service based on application requirement called as
      custom service.

    - in angularjs, we can create custom services in 5 ways.

        1. factory()

        2. service()

        3. provider()

        4. value()

        5. constant()


creating the custom service by using factory()
----------------------------------------------

app.factory("my_service",my_service);
function my_service(){
    return "Data From MongoDB Soon...";
}


app.controller("ctrl_one",ctrl_one);
function ctrl_one($scope,my_service){
    $scope.var_one = my_service;
}


app.controller("ctrl_two",ctrl_two);
function ctrl_two($scope,my_service){
    $scope.var_two = my_service;
}


creating the custom service by using service()
----------------------------------------------

    - service() function used to create the custom services.

    - service() depending on user defined functions to provide services to
      the controllers


Ex.
    app.service("my_service",my_service);

    function my_service(){

        this.fun_one = function(){
            return "Data From MySQL Soon....";
        }

        this.fun_two = function(){
            return "Data From MongoDB Soon....";
        }
    }



    app.controller("ctrl_one",ctrl_one);
    function ctrl_one($scope,my_service){
        $scope.var_one = my_service.fun_one();
    }


    app.controller("ctrl_two",ctrl_two);
    function ctrl_two($scope,my_service){
        $scope.var_two = my_service.fun_two();
    }

Services:
    - Services will provide the common business logic multiple controllers.

    - we have two types of services.

        1. predefined services

        2. custom services

custom services
---------------

- the services developed by developer based on application requirement called as
  custom services.

- in angular we can create the custom services in 5 ways.

    1. service()

    2. factory()

    3. value()

    4. constant()

    5. provider()


creating the custom service by using service()
----------------------------------------------
app.service("my_service",my_service);
function my_service(){

    this.fun_one = function(){
        return "Data From MongoDB...!";
    }

    this.fun_two = function(){
         return "Data from MySQL...!"
    }
}


app.controller("ctrl_one",ctrl_one);
function ctrl_one($scope,my_service){
    $scope.var_one = my_service.fun_one();
}


app.controller("ctrl_two",ctrl_two);
function ctrl_two($scope,my_service){
    $scope.var_two=my_service.fun_two();
}

[Note : service() depending on user defined functions to provide the
        services to controllers]

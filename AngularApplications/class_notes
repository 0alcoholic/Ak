    - by using angularjs, we can create two types of angular applications.

        1. static angular application

        2. dynamic angular application


static angular application:

    - if view won't interacts with the controller for dynamic data then such type of application called as
      static angular application.


steps to design the static angular application:
-----------------------------------------------

Step 1:

    download angular framework by using bower.


Step 2:

    load angular framework


Step 3:
    create view



- Angular Framework starts the execution from ng-app directive.

- static angular applications won't take take logical name of web application.

    Ex.
        ng-app

- ng-model directive creates the object internally with application data.

- ng-bind directive binds the application data (model data) to the view.



dynamic angular application:
----------------------------

    - if view interacts with the controller, for dynamic data then such type of application
      called as dynamic angular application.


steps to create the dynamic angular application:
------------------------------------------------

Step 1:
    download angular framework by using bower

Step 2:
    load angular framework

step 3:
    declare the logical name for the web application

step 4:
    declare the controller

Step 5:
    implement the controller.

    //create the object (Application Level Object)

    var app = angular.module("myApp",[]);   //@app  - object
                                            // we can call controllers, services, filters, directives....



    app.controller("ctrl" , ctrl);
    function ctrl(){
        //Business Logic
    }

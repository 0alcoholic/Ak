Angular Applications.

    - By using AngularJS we can develop two types of Applications.

    1. Static Angular Application

    2. Dynamic Angular Application.


 Static Angular Application.

        - If View won't interacts with the Controller for dynamic data , then such type of Angular Application

           Called as Static Angular Application.


 Dynamic Angular Application.

        - If Angular Application Follows MVC Design Pattern , Then Such Type Of Application called as Dynamic Angular Application

                                 (or)

        - If View Interacts with the Controller for Dynamic Data Then Such Type Applications also called as DAA.


Steps to Create the Static Angular Application.


Step 1.

        Download the Angular Framework by using bower.

------------------------
StaticAngularApplication

    bower.json

    .bowerrc
------------------------

bower.json
-
{
    "name":"nareshit",
     "dependencies":{
        "angular":"~1.6.0"
     }
}


.bowerrc
-
{
    "directory":"bower_components"
}


> bower install
[Note. StaticAngularApplication/bower_components/angular/angular.min.js]



Step 2.

Create the View by using "ng-app" , "ng-model" and "ng-bind" directives.

index.html
-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>

    <input type="number" ng-model="num_one"> <br><br>

    <input type="number" ng-model="num_two"> <br><br>

    <!-- <h1 style="color:red" ng-bind="num_one + num_two"></h1> -->

    <h1 style="color:green">{{num_one + num_two }} </h1>

    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>


    - Angular Framework starts the Execution from ng-app directive.

    - ng-app directive takes the logical name of web application

    - logical name is optional for "static angular applications"

    - logical name is mandatory for "dynamic angular applications"

    - "ng-model" directive internally creates the objects with dynamic data.

    - "ng-bind" directive binds the model data to the view.

    - we can bind the model data to the view by using "Expressions"


    Syntax.

    {{ }}

    - expressions by default displays the "unparsed / uncompiled" model data before binding.

    - in general we will use expressions in devEnvironment and "ng-bind" in production environment.

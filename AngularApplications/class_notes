Angular Applications.

    By using AngularJS We Can Create two types of Applications.

    1.Static Angular Application.

    2.Dynamic Angular Application.


Static Angular Application.

    - View won't interacts with the controller for dynamic data then such type of Angular Application Called as

    Static Angular Application.


Dynamic Angular Application.

    - View Interacts with the Controller for dynamic data then such type of Angular Application Called as

      dynamic Angular Application.


Bower

    Bower is the Automation Tool, used to download the Required Resources (Softwares) to Develop Web Application.

    Bower is the Automation Tool provided by NodeJS.

bower components

1.bower.json

  - used to mention required resources to develop web application.


2. .bowerrc

    - used to give the path for resources downloading by bower.


bower.json
-
{
    "name":"nareshit",
    "dependencies":{
            "angular" : "~1.6.0",
            "bootstrap" : "~3.3.6"
    }
}



.bowerrc
-

{
    "directory":"bower_components"
}



> bower install


 - When evee we run the bower , automatically bower will interact with the Server (NodeJS).

 - Node Server Automatically Interacts with the Git Repository for Resources.

 - Git Repository will download the Required Resources for Web Application Development based on "bower.json component"

 - "~" will downloads the latest version of resources.

 - "^" will download the exact version of resources



Steps to Create the Static Angular Application.
-

Step 1.

    Download the Angular Framework by using bower.



Step 2.

     Create the View.

 Ex.
     index.html


index.html
-

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html ng-app>

    <input type="number" ng-model="model_one">

    <input type="number" ng-model="model_two">

    <h1 style="color:red" ng-bind="model_one+model_two">


    <script src="/.........../angular.min.js"></script>
</html>

NodeJS?

    - NodeJS is a Platform used to Develop the Network & Server Side Applications.

    - NodeJS is a  Platform Built On Top Of "JavaScript" & "Google Chrome Engine" (V8).

    - Node Applications In Genaral we will develop by using JavaScript.

    - Node Applications are Mono Threaded Applications.

    - NodeJS is the Open Platform to Develop "Network" & "Server Side" Applications.

Advantages Of NodeJS
-
    - Open Source Code
            - We Can Customize the Server Accroding to Application Requirement.

    - Node Servers are ligth weigth Servers

    - Node Servers supports the Modules.

    - Node will provide so many predefined Modules.


Examples.

1. http
    - used to develop the http servers.

2. fs
    - fs stands for "file system".

    - this module used to interact with the flat files.

        Ex.

            Static Text Files

            Static JSON Files

            Static XML Files

                --
                --
                --

3. mutler
        - used to handle the multimedia files.


4. jwt-simple
        - used to maintain the token based authenication system.

5. mysql
         - used to interact with the mysql database.

6. mongodb
        - used to interact with the mongodb.

7. mssql
        - used to interact with the sql server.

8.express
        - used to develop the web services in node applications.

9.body-parser.
        - used to set the MIME Type.


        Ex.

            JSON

            XML

            Text

            doc

            docx
                --
                --

10. jsonToken

         - This Module is the Latest Module and used to maintain the
           Token Based Authentication System.

- We Can Implement the MiddleWare Services by using Node Server



Disadvantages Of NodeJS
-
1. Secuirity

2. No Middleware Services By Default.

3. Node Engines By Default Mono Threaded , because in general we will
   create the Servers by using javascript.


Key Features Of NodeJS.

1. clustering

    - we can create the number of child processes under the main process.

    - main process will moniter the number of child processes

    - by using clustering the development will be decreased,

      and application performance will be increased.


2. load balancing

    - we can take the multiple servers with internal communication  maintain load
      equally.

    - we can provide the communication between internal servers.


3. DNS
    - used to add the logical names to servers.
    - we can deploy the local Servers to public server with the help unique DNS.


4. callbacks support.

    - Node By default Supports the Callbacks in order to run the Node Applications
      Smoothly.


NodeJS Envinronmental Setup
-
    - The Softwares Required to run Node Application called as Environmental Setup.

Download and Install the NodeJS.
-
Website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Software Name : node-v6.11.0-x64.msi


Download and Install the IDE
1. WebStrom
2. Ecilipse
3. Visual Studio Code
4. Visual Studio


Visual Studio Code.
-
Website : https://code.visualstudio.com/
Software : VSCodeSetup-ia32-1.13.1.exe

    - we can download the Node Modules by using "package.json" file

Ex.

{
    "name":"nareshit",
    "version":"1.0.0",
    "description":"Basic package.json file"
    "dependencies":{
        //Modules
    },
    "devDependencies":{
        //Frameworks
        Ex.
            Karma
            Jasmine
            Gulp
            Grunt
            --
            --
            --
    }
}


//name : "name of project"

//author : "name of developer"

//licence : "licence information"

//version : "release version"

//repository : "source path of repository for dependencies"

//dependencies : "used to download the required modules to develop node application"

//devDependencies : downloading the 3rd party modules / frameworks to write "test cases"/"automation of tasks"....


Ex.

{
    "name":"demo",
    "version":"1.0.0",
    "description":"Basic Node Example",
    "licence":private,
    "dependencies":{
        "express":"^4.15.2"
    },
    "devDependencies":{
        "karma":"^1.1.0"
    }
}


> npm install

    - Automatically karma & express module downloads to "node_modules" folder.

    - "node_modules" folder created by node engine dynamically.

    - "npm" stands for "node packaging manager"

    - "npm" used to download the required "modules/frameworks" to develop the node applications.


Downloading the Required Modules Dynamically.
-

> npm install gulp --save-devDependencies

> npm install http --save-dependencies


list of Modules Downloaded
-

>npm list



uninstall the module
-
>npm uninstall gulp,express

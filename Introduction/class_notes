What is AngularJS.

    - AngularJS is a Client Side JavaScript Framework.

    - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model (JavaScript Variables)

        V - View  (HTML / HTML5 / JADE)

        C - Controller (JavaScript Functions)

    - AngularJS Have a So Many Predefined Modules, As a Angular Developer We Can Use Predefined Modules

        1.ngAnimate

                - used to develop the Animations in Angular Applications.


        2.ngMessages

                - used to perform the client side form validations.


        3.ngStorage

                - used to work with the Storages.

                - we have two types of Storages.

                        1.localStorage

                        2.sessionStorage

        4.ngRoute

                - used to handle the Routings in Single Page Applications.

                - ngRoute Module is the Native Module (Provided By Angular Framework(Google)).

                - now a days no body using the ngRoute Module because of it's limitations.


        5.ui.router

                - used to handle the Routings in Single Page Applications.

                - ui.router module is the 3rd party Module.

                - now a days all most all the Angular Projects Using ui.router Module in Single Page Applications.



Ex.

        //Develop the Angular Application with the Following Features

            1.Animations Support

            2.Form Validations

            3.SPA by using ui.router

            5.Storages Support





        index.html
        -

        <!DOCTYPE html>

        <html ng-app="myApp">

               //Our Application will Provide the Following Features

                1.Validations

                2.Routing

                3.Animations

                4.Storages


            <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
            <script>
               angular.module("myApp",["ngMessages","ui.router","ngAnimate","ngStorage"]);
            </script>
        </html>


        - Predefined Modules Eliminates the Much of the Code to Write



Advantages Of AngularJS.

1.As a Angular Developer We Can Directly work with the HTML DOM.

    DOM Stands for Document Object Model.


Ex.

    Copy the Data From One Div to Another Div By using HTML and JavaScript.
    index.html
    -
    <html>
        <div id="div_one">Hello</div>
        <div id="div_two"></div>
        <button onClick="my_fun()">Copy</button>
        <script>
            function my_fun(){
                document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML = document.getElementById("div_one").value;
            }
        </script>
    </html>

    [Note. We Can Dependent on JavaScript to work with the HTML DOM ]


    Copy the Data From "One Div" to "Another Div" By using AngularJS.

    <html ng-app = "app">

        <div ng-model="my_model">Hello</div>

        <div ng-bind="my_model"></div>

        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>

    </html>

         - Framework Starts the Execution from ng-app directive.

         - When ever framework encountered the ng-model , automatically object will be created in heap memory with

           Application Data.

         - ng-bind directive will binds the Application Data to the HTML Output Elements.


    [ Note. We Can Directly works with the HTML DOM By using Angular Directives ]




2.Angular Applications are Cross Browser Compatable Applications.

    - Framework will identifies the Required Plugin and Installs based on type of browser


3.Open Source Code

    - we can customize the framework accroding to application requirement.

2.Advantages of AngularJS.

3.Disadvantages Of AngularJS.

4.Key Features Of AngularJS.

5.Comparision Of AngularJS - Angular2

                 AngularJS - NodeJS

                 AngularJS - reactJS



1.What is AngularJS.

    - AngularJS is a client side javascript framework.

    - AngularJS Follow the MVC Design Pattern

        M - Model (JavaScript Variables)

        V - View (HTML / HTML5)

        C - Controller (JavaScript Functions)

    - AngularJS Framework contains so many predefined Modules, As a
      Angular Developer we can reuse the predefined Modules.

      1.ngAnimate

      2.ngMessages

      3.ngStorage

      4.ngRoute

      5.ui.router

        --

    ngAnimate.
        - used to develop the Animations in Angular Applications.

    ngMessages.
        - used to handle the client side form validations.

    ngStorage.
        - used to work with the storages.

        - we have two types of storages.

            1.localStorage

            2.sessionStorage

    ngRoute.

        - used to develop the single page applications.

        - it is native module.

        - now a days no project using ngRoute Module , because of it's limitations.

    ui.router.

        - used to develop the single page applications.

        - it is a 3rd party module.

        - now a days all most all the projects , they are using ui.router module in SPA.

    Example.

           //Develop the Angular Application with the Following Features.

            1.Animations Support

            2.Storages Support

            3.SPA Support - ui.router

            4.Form Validations



    index.html
    -
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html ng-app="app">

       //We Can Develop the Animations.

       //We Can work with the Storages

       //We Can Handle the Client Side Validations.

       //We Can Develop the SPA - ui.router


        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
        <script>
            angular.module("app",["ngAnimate","ngStorage","ui.router","ngMessages"]);
            (class) (function)
        </script>
    </html>

    - Predefined Modules eliminates much of the code to write.


Advantages Of AngularJS.

1.We Can Directly work with the HTML DOM.

    DOM Stands for Document Object Model.

Angular Applications.

    - By using AngularJS We Can Create the Two Types Of Applications.

    1.Static Angular Application

    2.Dynamic Angular Application


Static Angular Application.

    - If View not interacting with the controller for Dynamic Data Then Such Type Of Angular Application

        Called As Static Angular Application.


Dynamic Angular Application.

    - If View Interacting with the Controller For Dynamic Data Then Such type Of Angular Application

     Called As Dynamic Angular Application.




Steps to Create the Static Angular Application.


1.Download the Angular Framework by using bower.

    Bower is the Automation plugin used to download the Required Resources to Develop the Web Application.

    Bower is the Plugin Given By The NodeJS.

Bower Components.

1.bower.json

   {
    "dependencies":{
        "angular" : "~1.6.0",
        "bootstrap":"~3.3.6"
    }
   }


2. .bowerrc.json

{

    "directory":"bower_components"

}


> bower install

Angular Framework Path Given by bower.

"bower_components / angular / angular.min.js"




Step 2.

    Create the View (index.html)


index.html
-

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html ng-app>

    <input type="number" ng-model="model_one"> <br><br>

    <input type="number" ng-model="model_two"> <br><br>

    <h1 style="color:red" ng-bind="model_one+model_two"></h1>

    <script src = "bower_components / angular / angular.min.js"></script>

</html>

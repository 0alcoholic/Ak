What is AngularJS ??

    - AngularJS is the JavaScript client side framework.

    - AngularJS follows the MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model
            javascript variables called as model in angularjs.
            Ex.
                var data = "Data From DataBase Soon...";

        [Note : where "data" called as model in angularjs]


        V - View
            we can use HTML , HTML5, JADE, Python..... as the View in angularjs.


        C - Controller
            javascript functions called as controllers in angularjs.


Advantages of AngularJS:
-----------------------
1. angularjs supports modules.
    collection of classes called as module(javascript classes).

    - ngAnimate
        - this module used to develop the animations.

    - ngMessages
        - this module used to handle the form validations.

    - ngStorage
        - this module used to work with the storages.
        - we have two types of client side storages.
            1. localStorage
            2. sessionStorage

    - ngRoute
        - loading the "target webpage" to "source webpage" called as Routing in single page application.
        - this module used to implement the routing in single page application.
        - this module is the deprecated module, now a days "no project" using ngRoute Module.

    - ui.router
        - this module used to implement the Routing in single page application.
        - this module is 3rd party module.
        - ui.router module have so many advantages compared to ngRoute Module.
        - now a days all most all the projects using ui.router module in single page applications.

    Ex.

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html ng-app="app">   // ng-app directive used to assign the logical name for web application.

            //Logic Goes Here

            <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
            <script>
                var app = angular.module("app",["ngAnimate","ngStorage","ui.router"]);
                    (object)             (logical name)
            </script>
        </html>




2. As a angular developer we can directly work with HTML DOM.
    DOM Stands for Document Object Model.
   Ex.
    copy the data from "one div" to "another div" by using html and javascript.

    index.html
    -
    <html>
        <div id="div_one">Hello</div>
        <div id="div_two"></div>
        <script>
            document.grtElementById("div_two").innerHTML=
            document.getElementById("div_one").value;
        </script>
    </html>

    [Note : as a html & javascript developer , we must dependent
            on javascript to work with HTML DOM]



    Ex.
        copy the data from "one div" to "another div" by using angularjs.

    index.html
    -
    <html ng-app="app">
        <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>
        <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>
        <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
    </html>


    [1. framework (angular.min.js) starts the execution from ng-app directive

     2. "ng-model" directive creates the object in heap memory with application data

     3. "ng-bind" directive binds the "application data(model data)" to view(html).

     4.  as a angular developer we can work with HTML DOM by using angular directives instead of
         javascript
    ]

3. open source code

     - as a angular developer we can customize the framework accroding to application requirement.































            Ex.

                function ctrl(){
                    var data = "data from database"
                }

                [Note : where ctrl called as controller in angularJS]

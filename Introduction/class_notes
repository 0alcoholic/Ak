NodeJS?

    - NodeJS is a Platform used to Develop the Network & Server Side Applications.

    - NodeJS is a  Platform Built On Top Of "JavaScript" & "Google Chrome Engine" (V8).

    - Node Applications In Genaral we will develop by using JavaScript.

    - Node Applications are Mono Threaded Applications.

    - NodeJS is the Open Platform to Develop "Network" & "Server Side" Applications.

Advantages Of NodeJS
-
    - Open Source Code
            - We Can Customize the Server Accroding to Application Requirement.

    - Node Servers are ligth weigth Servers

    - Node Servers supports the Modules.

    - Node will provide so many predefined Modules.


Examples.

1. http
    - used to develop the http servers.

2. fs
    - fs stands for "file system".

    - this module used to interact with the flat files.

        Ex.

            Static Text Files

            Static JSON Files

            Static XML Files

                --
                --
                --

3. mutler
        - used to handle the multimedia files.


4. jwt-simple
        - used to maintain the token based authenication system.

5. mysql
         - used to interact with the mysql database.

6. mongodb
        - used to interact with the mongodb.

7. mssql
        - used to interact with the sql server.

8.express
        - used to develop the web services in node applications.

9.body-parser.
        - used to set the MIME Type.


        Ex.

            JSON

            XML

            Text

            doc

            docx
                --
                --

10. jsonToken

         - This Module is the Latest Module and used to maintain the
           Token Based Authentication System.

- We Can Implement the MiddleWare Services by using Node Server



Disadvantages Of NodeJS
-
1. Secuirity

2. No Middleware Services By Default.

3. Node Engines By Default Mono Threaded , because in general we will
   create the Servers by using javascript.


Key Features Of NodeJS.

1. clustering

    - we can create the number of child processes under the main process.

    - main process will moniter the number of child processes

    - by using clustering the development will be decreased,

      and application performance will be increased.


2. load balancing

    - we can take the multiple servers with internal communication  maintain load
      equally.

    - we can provide the communication between internal servers.


3. DNS
    - used to add the logical names to servers.
    - we can deploy the local Servers to public server with the help unique DNS.


4. callbacks support.

    - Node By default Supports the Callbacks in order to run the Node Applications
      Smoothly.

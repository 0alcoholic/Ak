AngularJS ?
    - AngularJS is the Framework.

            **************************************
library & framework ?

library .
    As a Developer we must call library while implementing the software application.

    Ex.

        jQuery

framework.
    - Framework will call our application.
    - While Implemeting The Software Application we must follow rules and regulations then only framework
      will call our application.

        Ex.  MVC

        ********************************************


      - AngularJS Follows MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model
        V - View
        C - Controller


      - AngularJS Have a so many predefined modules, as a angular developer we can reuse the predefined modules.

        1.ngAnimate
              - used to develop the Animations in Angular Applications.


        2.ngStorage

                - it is used to work with the storages.

                - we have two types of storages.

                    1.localStorage
                    2.sessionStorage

        3.ngMessages
                - used to handle the client side form validations.

        4.ngRoute

            - used to implement the Routing in Single Page Applications.

        5.ui.router

            - used to implement the Routing in Single Page Applications.

            - ui.router module is the 3rd party module.


       Ex.

        index.html
        -
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html ng-app = "app">

            //Develop Angular Application with the Following Features
            // 1. Animations
            // 2. Validations
            // 3. Storages
            // 4. routing with the latest module.


            <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>

            <script>
                angular.module("app",["ngAnimate","ngMessages","ngStorage","ui.router"]);
            </script>

        </html>


Advantages Of AngularJS.

1. As a Angular Developer We Can Directly work with the HTML DOM.

    DOM Stands for Document Object Model

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <div id="div_one">Hello</div>
    <div id="div_two"></div>

    <script>
       document.getElementByid("div_two").innerHTML = document.getElementById("div_one").value;
    </script>

</html>



------------------------------

index.html
-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>

    <div ng-model="model_one">Hello</div>
    <div ng-bind="model_one"></div>

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>



2. AngularJS Supports Two Way Data Binding.

    - Automatic Data Synchronization Between Model and View with the SuperVision Of Controller

     Called as Two way Data Binding.


[Note. Two Way Data Binding Reduces the Burden On The Server ]

    - AngularJS is a Client Side JavaScript Framework.

    - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model (JavaScript Variables)

        V - View  (HTML / HTML5)

        C - Controller (JavaScript Functions)


    - AngularJS Have a So Many Predefined Modules, As a Angular Developer We Can Reuse the Predefined Modules.

            - used to develop the Animations in Angular Applications.


        2.ngMessages

            - used to handle the client side form validations.


        3.ngStorage

            - used to work with the Storages.

            - we have two types of Storages.

                1.localStorage

                2.sessionStorage


        4.ngRoute

            - used to achieve the Routing in  Single Page Application.

            - ngRoute Module is the Predefined  Module, now a days no body using the ngRoute Module

              because of it's limitations.


        5.ui.router


            - used to handle the Routings in Single Page Applications.

            - ui.router module is the 3rd party module, now a days all most all the projects they are using

              ui.router module in SPA.

1.What is AngularJS.

    - AngularJS is a client side javascript framework.

    - AngularJS Follow the MVC Design Pattern

        M - Model (JavaScript Variables)

        V - View (HTML / HTML5)

        C - Controller (JavaScript Functions)

    - AngularJS Framework contains so many predefined Modules, As a
      Angular Developer we can reuse the predefined Modules.

      1.ngAnimate

      2.ngMessages

      3.ngStorage

      4.ngRoute

      5.ui.router

    ngAnimate.
        - used to develop the Animations in Angular Applications.

    ngMessages.
        - used to handle the client side form validations.

    ngStorage.
        - used to work with the storages.

        - we have two types of storages.

            1.localStorage

            2.sessionStorage

    ngRoute.

        - used to develop the single page applications.

        - it is native module.

        - now a days no project using ngRoute Module , because of it's limitations.

    ui.router.

        - used to develop the single page applications.

        - it is a 3rd party module.

        - now a days all most all the projects , they are using ui.router module in SPA.

    Example.

           //Develop the Angular Application with the Following Features.

            1.Animations Support

            2.Storages Support

            3.SPA Support - ui.router

            4.Form Validations



    index.html
    -
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html ng-app="app">

       //We Can Develop the Animations.

       //We Can work with the Storages

       //We Can Handle the Client Side Validations.

       //We Can Develop the SPA - ui.router


        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
        <script>
            angular.module("app",["ngAnimate","ngStorage","ui.router","ngMessages"]);
            (class) (function)
        </script>
    </html>

    - Predefined Modules eliminates much of the code to write.


Advantages Of AngularJS.

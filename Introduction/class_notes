AngularJS.

        - AngularJS is a JavaScript Client Side Framework.

        - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern

                        M - Model

                        Ex.
                            javascript variables called as model in angularjs.

                             var i = 100;
                             var data ="data from mongodb soon...."
                             where "i" & "data" called as model


                        V - View
                             Ex.
                                we can use HTML , HTML5, JADE as the View in AngularJS.


                        C - Controller
                                Ex.
                                    javascript functions called as controllers in angularjs.

                                    function ctrl(){
                                        var result = "data from database soon....";
                                    }



Advantages Of AngularJS
-


1. AngularJS "Supports/Provides" Predefined Modules.

   1.ngAnimate
    - it is used to develop the Animations in angular applications.

   2.ngStorage
    - it is used to work with the storages.
    - we have two types of storages

        1.localStorage
        2.sessionStorage

    3.ngMessages
        - it is used to handle the client side validations.

    4.ngRoute
        - it is used to implement the Routing in Single Page Application.
        - this module is the deprecated module.
        - now a days no body using the "ngRoute" module in Single Page Application Development.

    5.ui.router
        - it is used to implement the Routing in Single Page Application.
        - this module is the latest module provided by the 3rd party vendors.
        - now a days all most all the projects using "ui.router" module in single page application development.


    Ex.

          Develop the Angular Application with following features

            1. SPA - ui.router
            2. Validations
            3. Storages
            4. Animations


          ------------------
          DemoApp

             bower.json
             .bowerrc
             package.json
             Gulpfile.js

             index.html

          ---------------


bower.json
-
{
        "name":"nareshit",
         "dependencies":{
            "angular":"latest",
            "ngstorage":"latest
         }
}

.bowerrc
-
{
    "directory":"bower_components"
}

>bower install

angular path --> bower_components/angular/angular.min.js
storages path --> bower_components / ngstorage / ngStorage.min.js

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="app">

    //We can work with Storages.

    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script src="bower_components/ngstorage/ngStorage.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        var app = angular.module("app",["ngStorage"]);
    </script>
</html>

2. Open Source Code

    - As a Developer we can customize the Angular Framework accroding to application requirement.
    - we can add / modify / update / delete the features of Angular Framework.

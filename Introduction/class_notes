Advantages Of AngularJS.
-

     - We Can Directly (As An Angular Developer) work with the HTML DOM.

     - DOM Stands for Document Object Model.

Ex.

      Copy the Data from one "div" to another "div" by using HTML & JavaScript.

      index.html
      -

      <html>
        <div id="div_one">Hello</div>
        <div id="div_two"></div>
        <button onClick="copy()">Copy</button>


        <script>
            function copy(){
                document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML =
                document.getElementById("div_one").value;
            }
        </script>
      </html>

      [Note. we can work with the HTML DOM By using External JavaSCript ]


      Ex.

        Copy The Data From One Div to Another Div By using AngularJS.

        <html ng-app="app">

            <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>
            <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>
            <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>

        </html>

        [Note. We Can Directly Work with the HTML DOM without JavaScript ] .


        - framework starts the execution from ng-app directive.

        - ng-model directive internally creates the object with data.

        - ng-bind directive binds the model data to the HTML Elements.


- AngularJS Supports the Two Way Data Binding.

    - Automatic Data Synchronization Between Model and View Called as Two Way Data Binding.



    1. http get request.

        - used to fetch the data from server.

    2. http post request.

        - used to delete a perticular record from database.

    3. data sync request

        - used to sync the model data(database data) with the view.



    [Note 1. As a Programming Language Developers (Java , dot net) , we must make above three server hits

             to meet application requirement ]

    [Note 2. As a Angular Developer We Can Make only two server hits to meet application requirement].

    [Note. Two Way Data Binding also Reduces the Burden on the Server]

AngularJS

      - AngularJS is the Client Side JavaScript Framework.

      - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

                    M - Model

                        EX
                            var s="Data from the Data Base Soon....";
                            where "s" can call model in angularJS.

                    V - View

                        We Can use HTML , HTML5 (or) JADE as the View in AngularJS.

                    C - Controller

                         JavaScript Function are Recomended as Controllers in AngularJS

                         Ex.

                            function fetchMySQLData(){

                                return "Data From MySQLDB Soon....";
                            }


      -  Angular Framework , have a so many predefined Modules as a Angular Developer we can use the

         Predefined Modules.


         Ex.

            ngStorage

                - This module used to work with the Storages.

                - We Have Two Types Of Storages

                    1.localStorage

                    2.sessionStorage

                 localStorage.

                       - As a Developer we must delete the localStorage.

                 sessionStorage.

                        - If We "Close the Browser" / "Opens the New Tab" Automatically we will lost

                        the session Data.


            2. ngAnimate

                    - used to develop the Animations in Angular Applications.

            3. ngMessages

                    - used to handle the Client Side Form Validations.

            4. ngRoute

                    - used to implement the Routing in Single Page Application.

                    - ngRoute Module is Deprecated Module.


             5. ui.router

                    - used to implement the Routing in Single Page Applications.

                    - ui.router module is the 3rd party Module.

                    - now a days all most all the projects , they are using ui.router module in Single
                      Page Applications.


Ex.
index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="app">
    //SPA - ui.router
    //Animations
    //Storages
    //Validations
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script>
       var app = angular.module("app",["ngStorage","ui.router","ngMessages","ngAnimate"]);
    <script>
</html>

    - "ng-app" is the Predefined Directive used to assign the logical name for the Web Application.

    - "angular" is the Predefined Class in "angular.min.js"

    - "module( - , - )" is the Predefined Function in angular class , and Returns the JavaScript Object.

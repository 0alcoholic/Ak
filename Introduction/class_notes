                 AngularJS - NodeJS

                 AngularJS - reactJS


AngularJS

      - AngularJS is the Client Side JavaScript Framework.

      - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

                    M - Model

                        EX
                            var s="Data from the Data Base Soon....";
                            where "s" can call model in angularJS.

                    V - View

                        We Can use HTML , HTML5 (or) JADE as the View in AngularJS.

                    C - Controller

                         JavaScript Function are Recomended as Controllers in AngularJS

                         Ex.

                            function fetchMySQLData(){

                                return "Data From MySQLDB Soon....";
                            }


      -  Angular Framework , have a so many predefined Modules as a Angular Developer we can use the

         Predefined Modules.


         Ex.

            ngStorage

                - This module used to work with the Storages.

                - We Have Two Types Of Storages

                    1.localStorage

                    2.sessionStorage

                 localStorage.

                       - As a Developer we must delete the localStorage.

                 sessionStorage.

                        - If We "Close the Browser" / "Opens the New Tab" Automatically we will lost

                        the session Data.


            2. ngAnimate

                    - used to develop the Animations in Angular Applications.

            3. ngMessages

                    - used to handle the Client Side Form Validations.

            4. ngRoute

                    - used to implement the Routing in Single Page Application.

                    - ngRoute Module is Deprecated Module.


             5. ui.router

                    - used to implement the Routing in Single Page Applications.

                    - ui.router module is the 3rd party Module.

                    - now a days all most all the projects , they are using ui.router module in Single
                      Page Applications.


Ex.
index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="app">
    //SPA - ui.router
    //Animations
    //Storages
    //Validations
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script>
       var app = angular.module("app",["ngStorage","ui.router","ngMessages","ngAnimate"]);
    <script>
</html>

    - "ng-app" is the Predefined Directive used to assign the logical name for the Web Application.

    - "angular" is the Predefined Class in "angular.min.js"

    - "module( - , - )" is the Predefined Function in angular class , and Returns the JavaScript Object.

Advantages Of AngularJS
-
1. As a Angular Developer , We Can Directly work with the HTML DOM.

    DOM Stands for Document Object Model


Ex.

    Copy the Data From One Div to Another Div By using HTML & JavaScript

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <div id="div_one">Hello</div>
    <div id="div_two"></div>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML =
        document.getElementById("div_one").value;
    </script>
</html>

[Note . As a HTML & JavaScript Developer we must dependent on JavaScript to work with the HTML DOM ]


index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>
	<div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>
	<div ng-bind="div_one"></div>
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>


1. Angular Framework (angular.min.js) starts the Execution from "ng-app" directive.

2. "ng-model" directive internally creates the object with application data.

3. "ng-bind" directive binds the application data to html output element.


2. AngularJS Supports the Two Way Data Binding


    Automatic Data Synchronization Between Model and View with the Supervision Of Controller Called as

    Two Way Data Binding.



 - In the Above Diagram we have Following Server Calls.


  1. http get request

  2. http delete request

  3. Async Call (Ajax Call)



  - As a Programming Languages Developer We Must Make above three server calls to meet application requirement.

  - As a AngularJS / Angular4 Developer We can only two Server Calls to meet application Requirement because of

    Two Way Data Binding.


[Note . Two Way Data Binding Reduces the Burden on the Server ]



3. AngularJS(Framework) is the Open Source Code.

    - We Can Customize the Framework accroding to application requirement.


4. Angular Applications are Cross Browser Compatable Applications.

    We Can Run Angular Applications in all Browsers (IE 10 onwards) with out adding plugins.

    Angular Applications are "Cross Browser" / "Cross Platform" Compatable Applications.



5. AngularJS Reduces the Burden on the Server.

    We Can Implement the Business Components at client side by using MVC , automatically burden will be reduced

    on Server.


Disadvantages Of AngularJS
-
    - Understanding the Angular Applications are Difficult , because of no Coding Standards.

    - Secuirity

    - We Must Enable the JavaScript in Browsers , then only angular applications will execute.


Key Features Of AngularJS.
-

1. Directives

    - Directives in AngularJS, Enhances the HTML Capabilities.

    - We Have Two Types Of Directives.

    1. Predefined Directives

    2. Custom Directives

Predefined Directives.

    - The Directives Given by the Angular Framework called as Predefined Directives.

    Ex.

        ng-app
        ng-repeat
        ng-options

        --
        --
        --


Custom Directives.

    - Creating Our Own Directive , Based on application requirement called as Custom Directive.

    Ex.
     my_header

    - by using custom directives , we can reuse the "business logic"




2. Controllers.

    - Controllers acting as glue between "Model & View"
    - We Can have More Than One Controller Per Web Application.


3. Services

    - Services are used to maintain the Common Business Logic.

    - By using Services , we can reuse the "Business Logic"

    - it's recomended to create the services with "Common Business Logic" instead of controllers.

    - Services Can Provide the "Common Services" to the Controllers.

    - We Have Two Types Of Services.

        1. Predefined Services

            Ex.

                $http


        2. Custom Services

            Ex.

                my_service



4. Single Page Applications

        - AngularJS Supports the Single Page Applications.

        - Loading the "Target Web Page" to "Source Web page" without refreshing the whole web page called as

          Single Page Application.



5. Filters

    - we can format the data accroding to application requirement.

    - We have Two Types Of Filters.

        1. Predefined Filters

        2. Custom Filters



6. Modules

    - We Can have Multiple Modules in Angular Applications.

    - We Can Provide the Communication Between Modules.

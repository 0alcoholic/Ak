Advantages Of AngularJS.
-
1. AngularJS Supports the "Two Way Data Binding".
    - Automatic Data Synchronization Between "Model and View" with the SuperVision
      Of Controller Called as Two Way data binding.


     -Two way Data Binding Reduces the Burden On the Server.


In the Above Diagram we have following http server Requests.
-

1. http - get request
    - used to fetch the data from database.

2. http - delete request
      - used to delete a particular record from the database.

3. Ajax Call
      - used to Sync the Data Between Model (DataBase) and View (HTML).

    - As a Programming languages developer (Java, dot net, Php...), we must make the
      above all requests to meet application requirement.

    - As a AngularJS / Angular2 Developer we can make only two calls to meet application
      requirement.

    - Two way Data Binding  Eliminates the "Making the 3rd Server Hit(Ajax call)"


2. As a Angular Developer We Can Directly work with the HTML DOM.

    - DOM Stands for Document Object Model.

 Ex.
     Copy the Data From One Div to Another Div by using HTML&JavaScript.

    [Note . As a HTML & JavaScript Developer we can dependent on JavaScript to
            work with Document Object Model]


 Ex.
    Copy the Data From One Div to Another Div Bu using AngularJS.

    [Note. As a Angular Developer we can work with the HTML DOM By using Angular
           Directives

           Ex.

            ng-app

            ng-model

            ng-bind ]

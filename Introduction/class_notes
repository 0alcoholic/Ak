                  AngularJS - NodeJS

                  AngularJS - d3js


AngularJS.

        - AngularJS is a JavaScript Client Side Framework.

        - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern

                        M - Model

                        Ex.
                            javascript variables called as model in angularjs.

                             var i = 100;
                             var data ="data from mongodb soon...."
                             where "i" & "data" called as model


                        V - View
                             Ex.
                                we can use HTML , HTML5, JADE as the View in AngularJS.


                        C - Controller
                                Ex.
                                    javascript functions called as controllers in angularjs.

                                    function ctrl(){
                                        var result = "data from database soon....";
                                    }



Advantages Of AngularJS
-


1. AngularJS "Supports/Provides" Predefined Modules.

   1.ngAnimate
    - it is used to develop the Animations in angular applications.

   2.ngStorage
    - it is used to work with the storages.
    - we have two types of storages

        1.localStorage
        2.sessionStorage

    3.ngMessages
        - it is used to handle the client side validations.

    4.ngRoute
        - it is used to implement the Routing in Single Page Application.
        - this module is the deprecated module.
        - now a days no body using the "ngRoute" module in Single Page Application Development.

    5.ui.router
        - it is used to implement the Routing in Single Page Application.
        - this module is the latest module provided by the 3rd party vendors.
        - now a days all most all the projects using "ui.router" module in single page application development.


    Ex.

          Develop the Angular Application with following features

            1. SPA - ui.router
            2. Validations
            3. Storages
            4. Animations


          ------------------
          DemoApp

             bower.json
             .bowerrc
             package.json
             Gulpfile.js

             index.html

          ---------------


bower.json
-
{
        "name":"nareshit",
         "dependencies":{
            "angular":"latest",
            "ngstorage":"latest
         }
}

.bowerrc
-
{
    "directory":"bower_components"
}

>bower install

angular path --> bower_components/angular/angular.min.js
storages path --> bower_components / ngstorage / ngStorage.min.js

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="app">

    //We can work with Storages.

    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script src="bower_components/ngstorage/ngStorage.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        var app = angular.module("app",["ngStorage"]);
    </script>
</html>

2. Open Source Code

    - As a Developer we can customize the Angular Framework accroding to application requirement.
    - we can add / modify / update / delete the features of Angular Framework.



3. As a Angular Developer we can directly work with the HTML DOM.

    DOM Stands for Document Object Model.

    Ex.
        Copy the data from "one division" to "another division" by using HTML & JavaScript

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <div id="div_one">
                Hello
            </div>
            <div id="div_two"></div>
            <script>
                document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML =
                document.getElementById("div_one").value;
            </script>
        </html>

        [Note : as a "HTML" & "JavaScript Developer" we must dependent on JavaScript to work on DOM ]


   Ex.
        copy the data from "one division" to "another division" by using AngularJS.


    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html ng-app>
         <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>
         <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>
        <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
    </html>

    [Note : we can work with the HTML DOM by using angular directives.]

    [ - in above program framework starts the execution from "ng-app" directive

      - "ng-model" directive creates the object in heap memory with the application data

      - "ng-bind" directive binds the "model data" to the "view".
    ]


4. AngularJS Supports Two Way Data Binding.

    Automatic Data Synchronization Between Model and View with the SuperVision Of Controller Called as

    two way data binding.


    In the above diagram we have following server calls.

    1. http get request
    2. http delete request
    3. Async call (AJAX)

    As a programming languages developer we must make above "all server calls" to meet application requirement.

    As a angular/angular4 developer we can make only [ two server calls ] to meet application requirement.

[Note : two way data binding reduces the burden on the server ]

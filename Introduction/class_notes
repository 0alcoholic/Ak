                  AngularJS - reactJS

                  AngularJS - NodeJS


AngularJS

       - AngularJS is a JavaScript Framework.

       - AngularJS Follows th MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model

            JavaScript Variables Called as Model.

           Ex.

                var data = "Data From MongoDB Soon...";

           [Note: where "data"  can call Model in AngularJS]


        C - Controller

            JavaScript Functions Called as Controllers

        Ex.

            function getData(){
                //Business Logic Goes Here
            }

        [Note . where getData() function called as Controller in AngularJS ]


        V - View

            - We Can Use HTML , HTML5 (OR) JADE as the View in AngularJS




        - Angular Framework have Predefined Modules , As a Angular Developer we can use the

          Predefined Modules while Developing the Angular Application.

          [Module: Collection Of Classes Implementations ]



1. ngAnimate

    - This Module used to Develop the Animations in Angular Applications.



2. ngStorage

    - This Module used to work with the Storages.

    - We Have Two Types Of Client Side Storages.

        1. localStorage

        2. sessionStorage


3. ngMessages

     - This Module used to Handle the Client Side Form Validations.


4. ngRoute

    - This Module used to Handle the Routing in Single Page Application.

    - ngRoute Module is Deprecated Module.


5. ui.router

    - This Module used to Handle the Routing the in Single Page Appliction.

    - ui.router module is the 3rd party module.

    - ui.router module have so many advantages Compared to ngRoute Module, so now a days

      we are using ui.router Module in Single Page Applications.



Ex.

index.html
-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="myApp">
    //SPA - ui.router
    //Validations
    //Storages
    //Animations
    <script src = "bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        var app = angular.module("myApp",["ui.router","ngMessages","ngStorage","ngAnimate"]);
    </script>
</html>

Advantages Of AngularJS
-
1. As a Angular Developer , We Can Directly work with the HTML DOM.

[DOM Stands for Document Object Model.]


Ex.

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

    <div id="div_one">Hello</div>

    <div id="div_two"></div>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML = document.getElementById("div_one").value;
    </script>
</html>

[Note . As a HTML Developer , we can dependent on JavaScript to perform the DOM Manipulations]



index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>

    <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>

    <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>

    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>

</html>

[Note . We can Manipulate the DOM By using Angular Directives

    Ex.

        ng-app

        ng-model

        ng-bind ]


    - Angular Framework starts the Execution from root directive (ng-app).

    - ng-app directive takes the logical name of web application.

    - logical name is optional for static angular applications ,
      and mandatory for Dynamic Angular Applications.

    - ng-model directive creates the object in heap memory with application data.

    - ng-bind directive binds the model data to the view.




2. AngularJS Supports Two Way Data Binding.

    - Automatic Data Synchronization Between Model and View with the Supervision Of Controller
      Called as Two Way Data Binding.


Ex.


        In the Above Diagram we have Following server Calls.

1. http get request
    - this request used to fetch the data from database.

2. http delete request
    - this request used to delete the particular record from database.

3. Ajax Request
     - this request used to avoid the data in consistency problem.


[Note. As a programming languages developers , we must make above requests to complete
       application requirement.]

[Note. As a AngularJS / Angular2 Developer We can make only "Two Server Requests" to complete
       application requirement
       1. http get request
       2. http delete request ]


    - when ever record deleted successfully , automatically db will return success notification
      to controller.

    - controller will delete the specific record from Model when ever receives the Notification
      from server.

    - When ever we delete the Record from Model Automatically View will reflect with changes.
        (Two Way Data Binding)

    - Two Way Data Binding Reduces the Burden on the Server.


3. Open Source Code

    - We Can Customize the Framework Accroding to Application Requirement

    - We Can Modify the Source Code Accroding to Application Needs.

    - We Can Add the Features , Update the Features and Delete the Features From Framework.


4. Angular Applications are "Cross Platform" and "Cross Browser Compatable"  Applications.

    - When ever we develop the Angular Application, automatically compatable with all browser with
      out adding external plugins.

    - "IE 10" onwards no need to add plugins to run angular applications.


5. AngularJS Reduces the Burden on the Server.

    - As a Angular Developer , we can implement the Business Components at Client Side By using
      MVC automatically Burden will be Reduced on Server.


Disadvantages Of AngularJS
-
1. Understanding the Angular Applications are Difficult Because of No Coding Standards Provided
   by Vendor.

2. We are loosing the Secuirity by using Angular Framework.

3. We Must Enable the JavaScript in Browser.


Key Features Of AngularJS
-







Predefined Directives.
    - The Directives Given by the Angular Framework Called as Predefined Directives.
Ex.
     ng-app
     ng-model
     ng-bind
     --
     --
     --
Custom Directives.
    - The Directives Developed By the Developer Based On Application Requirement Called as
      Custom Directives.

Ex.
    - in above diagram we developed we Templates (header.html & footer.html).

    - we developed two custom directives with the help of above templates
      (my_header , footer)

    - we can reuse the Custom Directives in angular applications.

    - by using Custom Directive we can overcome the Data Redundency


Services
-
    - By using Service , we can share the Common Business Logic to Controllers.

    - we have Two Types Of Services.

            1. Predefined Services

            2. Custom Services.

    Predefined Services.

          - The Services Given by the Framework Called as Predefined services.

          Ex.

            $http

                - By using This Service We Can Connect to Servers via http protocol.

                    Ex.

                        Tomcat
                        IIS
                        Xampp
                        Wampp
                        NodeJS


            $q.
                - By using this Service , we Can make Async Calls.


            $timeout
                - This Predefined Service Used to maintain the Session while Interacting
                  with the Servers


            $interval.
                - This Service Used to Maintain the "Iteratable Custom Function" with a
                  Specified Interval of time.

            $location.

                - This Service Used to Return the Absolute Path of Web Application.

    Custom Services.
        - Creating Our Own Services Based on Application Requirement Called as
          Custom Service.



3. Single Page Applications.

    - Loading the Target Webpage to Source Webpage with out refreshing the whole web application
      called as Single Page Application.


4. Filters.

    - Filters are used to format the "Application Data" accroding to application requirement.

    We Have Two Types Of Filters.

        1. Predefined filter

        2. Custom Filter

    Predefined Filter.

            The Filters Given by the Framework called as Predefined Filters.

            Ex.

                date

                currency

                lowercase

                uppercase

                json

                --
                --
                --

    Custom Filters.

      - The Filters Developed By the Developer Based On Application Requirement
        Called as Custom Filters.

      Ex.

           my_currency



Comparision Of AngularJS with Angular2.

    - By using AngularJS , we can create only web applications.
    - By using Angular2 we can develop web and Mobile Applications.
      [Note . with the ionic framework only we can develop mobile applications]


    - In genaral we will develop AngularJS Applications by using javascript
      In genaral we will develop Angular2 Applications by using TypeScript
      [Note. TypeScript is the Superset of JavaScript]


    - Angular2 Easy Compared to AngularJS.

    - Angular2 have 5X more Performance Compared to AngularJS.

    - In Genaral we Can Run AngularJS Applications in Browsers Directly.
      We can Run Angular2 in Browser with Transpilation.

      [Transpilation : Converting the TypeScript to JavaScript called as Transpilation

        We can use the "tsc" compiler to perform transpilation]

    - JavaScript is the Scripting Language
      TypeScript is the Programming Language.



Differences Between AngularJS with reactJS ??

    - AngularJS is the Framework.
      reactJS is the library.


    - AngularJS May Not Suggestable for DataStructres Implementations.
      reactJS is Best Choice for DataStructures Implementations.

    - AngularJS Supports Two way databinding.
      reactJS Supports One way data binding.

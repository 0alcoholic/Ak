5. Comparision Of AngularJS - Angular2

                  AngularJS - reactJS

                  AngularJS - NodeJS


AngularJS

       - AngularJS is a JavaScript Framework.

       - AngularJS Follows th MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model

            JavaScript Variables Called as Model.

           Ex.

                var data = "Data From MongoDB Soon...";

           [Note: where "data"  can call Model in AngularJS]


        C - Controller

            JavaScript Functions Called as Controllers

        Ex.

            function getData(){
                //Business Logic Goes Here
            }

        [Note . where getData() function called as Controller in AngularJS ]


        V - View

            - We Can Use HTML , HTML5 (OR) JADE as the View in AngularJS




        - Angular Framework have Predefined Modules , As a Angular Developer we can use the

          Predefined Modules while Developing the Angular Application.

          [Module: Collection Of Classes Implementations ]



1. ngAnimate

    - This Module used to Develop the Animations in Angular Applications.



2. ngStorage

    - This Module used to work with the Storages.

    - We Have Two Types Of Client Side Storages.

        1. localStorage

        2. sessionStorage


3. ngMessages

     - This Module used to Handle the Client Side Form Validations.


4. ngRoute

    - This Module used to Handle the Routing in Single Page Application.

    - ngRoute Module is Deprecated Module.


5. ui.router

    - This Module used to Handle the Routing the in Single Page Appliction.

    - ui.router module is the 3rd party module.

    - ui.router module have so many advantages Compared to ngRoute Module, so now a days

      we are using ui.router Module in Single Page Applications.



Ex.

index.html
-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="myApp">
    //SPA - ui.router
    //Validations
    //Storages
    //Animations
    <script src = "bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        var app = angular.module("myApp",["ui.router","ngMessages","ngStorage","ngAnimate"]);
    </script>
</html>

Advantages Of AngularJS
-
1. As a Angular Developer , We Can Directly work with the HTML DOM.

[DOM Stands for Document Object Model.]


Ex.

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

    <div id="div_one">Hello</div>

    <div id="div_two"></div>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML = document.getElementById("div_one").value;
    </script>
</html>

[Note . As a HTML Developer , we can dependent on JavaScript to perform the DOM Manipulations]



index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>

    <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>

    <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>

    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>

</html>

[Note . We can Manipulate the DOM By using Angular Directives

    Ex.

        ng-app

        ng-model

        ng-bind ]


    - Angular Framework starts the Execution from root directive (ng-app).

    - ng-app directive takes the logical name of web application.

    - logical name is optional for static angular applications ,
      and mandatory for Dynamic Angular Applications.

    - ng-model directive creates the object in heap memory with application data.

    - ng-bind directive binds the model data to the view.




2. AngularJS Supports Two Way Data Binding.

    - Automatic Data Synchronization Between Model and View with the Supervision Of Controller
      Called as Two Way Data Binding.


Ex.


        In the Above Diagram we have Following server Calls.

1. http get request
    - this request used to fetch the data from database.

2. http delete request
    - this request used to delete the particular record from database.

3. Ajax Request
     - this request used to avoid the data in consistency problem.


[Note. As a programming languages developers , we must make above requests to complete
       application requirement.]

[Note. As a AngularJS / Angular2 Developer We can make only "Two Server Requests" to complete
       application requirement
       1. http get request
       2. http delete request ]


    - when ever record deleted successfully , automatically db will return success notification
      to controller.

    - controller will delete the specific record from Model when ever receives the Notification
      from server.

    - When ever we delete the Record from Model Automatically View will reflect with changes.
        (Two Way Data Binding)

    - Two Way Data Binding Reduces the Burden on the Server.


3. Open Source Code

    - We Can Customize the Framework Accroding to Application Requirement

    - We Can Modify the Source Code Accroding to Application Needs.

    - We Can Add the Features , Update the Features and Delete the Features From Framework.


4. Angular Applications are "Cross Platform" and "Cross Browser Compatable"  Applications.

    - When ever we develop the Angular Application, automatically compatable with all browser with
      out adding external plugins.

    - "IE 10" onwards no need to add plugins to run angular applications.


5. AngularJS Reduces the Burden on the Server.

    - As a Angular Developer , we can implement the Business Components at Client Side By using
      MVC automatically Burden will be Reduced on Server.


Disadvantages Of AngularJS
-
1. Understanding the Angular Applications are Difficult Because of No Coding Standards Provided
   by Vendor.

2. We are loosing the Secuirity by using Angular Framework.

3. We Must Enable the JavaScript in Browser.

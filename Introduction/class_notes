2. Advantages Of AngularJS ??

3. Disadvantages Of AngularJS ??

4. Key Features Of AngularJS ??

5. Comparision Of AngularJS - Angular2

                  AngularJS - reactJS

                  AngularJS - NodeJS


AngularJS

       - AngularJS is a JavaScript Framework.

       - AngularJS Follows th MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model

            JavaScript Variables Called as Model.

           Ex.

                var data = "Data From MongoDB Soon...";

           [Note: where "data"  can call Model in AngularJS]


        C - Controller

            JavaScript Functions Called as Controllers

        Ex.

            function getData(){
                //Business Logic Goes Here
            }

        [Note . where getData() function called as Controller in AngularJS ]


        V - View

            - We Can Use HTML , HTML5 (OR) JADE as the View in AngularJS




        - Angular Framework have Predefined Modules , As a Angular Developer we can use the

          Predefined Modules while Developing the Angular Application.

          [Module: Collection Of Classes Implementations ]



1. ngAnimate

    - This Module used to Develop the Animations in Angular Applications.



2. ngStorage

    - This Module used to work with the Storages.

    - We Have Two Types Of Client Side Storages.

        1. localStorage

        2. sessionStorage


3. ngMessages

     - This Module used to Handle the Client Side Form Validations.


4. ngRoute

    - This Module used to Handle the Routing in Single Page Application.

    - ngRoute Module is Deprecated Module.


5. ui.router

    - This Module used to Handle the Routing the in Single Page Appliction.

    - ui.router module is the 3rd party module.

    - ui.router module have so many advantages Compared to ngRoute Module, so now a days

      we are using ui.router Module in Single Page Applications.



Ex.

index.html
-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="myApp">
    //SPA - ui.router
    //Validations
    //Storages
    //Animations
    <script src = "bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        var app = angular.module("myApp",["ui.router","ngMessages","ngStorage","ngAnimate"]);
    </script>
</html>

Advantages Of AngularJS
-
1. As a Angular Developer , We Can Directly work with the HTML DOM.

[DOM Stands for Document Object Model.]


Ex.

index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

    <div id="div_one">Hello</div>

    <div id="div_two"></div>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML = document.getElementById("div_one").value;
    </script>
</html>

[Note . As a HTML Developer , we can dependent on JavaScript to perform the DOM Manipulations]



index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>

    <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>

    <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>

    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>

</html>

[Note . We can Manipulate the DOM By using Angular Directives

    Ex.

        ng-app

        ng-model

        ng-bind ]


    - Angular Framework starts the Execution from root directive (ng-app).

    - ng-app directive takes the logical name of web application.

    - logical name is optional for static angular applications ,
      and mandatory for Dynamic Angular Applications.

    - ng-model directive creates the object in heap memory with application data.

    - ng-bind directive binds the model data to the view.

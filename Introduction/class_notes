What is AngularJS ??

    - AngularJS is the JavaScript client side framework.

    - AngularJS follows the MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model
            javascript variables called as model in angularjs.
            Ex.
                var data = "Data From DataBase Soon...";

        [Note : where "data" called as model in angularjs]


        V - View
            we can use HTML , HTML5, JADE, Python..... as the View in angularjs.


        C - Controller
            javascript functions called as controllers in angularjs.


Advantages of AngularJS:
-----------------------
1. angularjs supports modules.
    collection of classes called as module(javascript classes).

    - ngAnimate
        - this module used to develop the animations.

    - ngMessages
        - this module used to handle the form validations.

    - ngStorage
        - this module used to work with the storages.
        - we have two types of client side storages.
            1. localStorage
            2. sessionStorage

    - ngRoute
        - loading the "target webpage" to "source webpage" called as Routing in single page application.
        - this module used to implement the routing in single page application.
        - this module is the deprecated module, now a days "no project" using ngRoute Module.

    - ui.router
        - this module used to implement the Routing in single page application.
        - this module is 3rd party module.
        - ui.router module have so many advantages compared to ngRoute Module.
        - now a days all most all the projects using ui.router module in single page applications.

    Ex.

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html ng-app="app">   // ng-app directive used to assign the logical name for web application.

            //Logic Goes Here

            <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
            <script>
                var app = angular.module("app",["ngAnimate","ngStorage","ui.router"]);
                    (object)             (logical name)
            </script>
        </html>




2. As a angular developer we can directly work with HTML DOM.
    DOM Stands for Document Object Model.
   Ex.
    copy the data from "one div" to "another div" by using html and javascript.

    index.html
    -
    <html>
        <div id="div_one">Hello</div>
        <div id="div_two"></div>
        <script>
            document.grtElementById("div_two").innerHTML=
            document.getElementById("div_one").value;
        </script>
    </html>

    [Note : as a html & javascript developer , we must dependent
            on javascript to work with HTML DOM]



    Ex.
        copy the data from "one div" to "another div" by using angularjs.

    index.html
    -
    <html ng-app="app">
        <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>
        <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>
        <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
    </html>


    [1. framework (angular.min.js) starts the execution from ng-app directive

     2. "ng-model" directive creates the object in heap memory with application data

     3. "ng-bind" directive binds the "application data(model data)" to view(html).

     4.  as a angular developer we can work with HTML DOM by using angular directives instead of
         javascript
    ]

3. open source code

     - as a angular developer we can customize the framework accroding to application requirement.



4. two way data binding
    - angularjs supports two way data binding.

    [ automatic data syncronization between model and view with the supervision of controller
    called as "two way data binding" ]




    - in the above diagram , we have following server calls.

    1. http get request

           - used to fetch the all employee details from database.

    2. http delete request

            - used to delete the particular employee details from database.

    3. AJAX Call

            - used to sync the data between "view" and "database".



    [Note : as a programming languages developer we must make above all requests to meet
            application requirement

            Ex.
                java
                dot net
                php
                --
                -- ]

    [Note : as a angularjs / angular2 developer we can only two server calls because of two way data binding]

    [Note : two way data binding reduces the burden on the server]


Disadvantages of AngularJS
--------------------------
1. secuirity
    we are implementing the business components at client side , so we are missing the secuirity.

2. client (browser) must enables the javascript.

3. understanding the angular applications are difficult because of no coding standards from vendors.


key features of angularjs
-------------------------

1. single page applications

    loading the "target web pages" to "source web page" without refreshing the whole application
    called as single page applications.

    as a angular developer we can develop the single page applications.



2. directives
    directives in angularjs , enhances the html capabilities.

    we have two types of directives.

        1. predefined directives
                - the directives given by the framework called as predefined directives.
                Ex.
                    ng-app
                    ng-model
                    ng-bind

        2. custom directives
                - the directives developed by developer called as custom directives.
                Ex.
                    my_dir

3. services
    - we can share the common business logic to multiple controllers with the help of services.
    - we have two types of services.
        1.predefined services
            - the services given by the framework called as predefined services.
                Ex.
                    $http - used to connect to servers by using http protocol
                    $q    - used to make the async calls
                    $interval - used to execute a custom function repetedely
                    $timeout - used to execute a custom function with a given specified time
                    $location - used to know the absolute path of web application.

        2. custom services:
            - creating our own service based on application requirement called as custom service.


4. filters
    - filters are used to format the application data.
    - we have two types of filters

        1. predefined filters
            - the filters given by the framework called as predefined filters.
        2. custom filters
            - the filters developed by developer called as custom filters.


differences between angularjs - angular2
----------------------------------------

    - by using angularjs , we can prepare web applications.
      by using angular2 , we can prepare web and mobile applications.
        [Note : we can prepare the mobile applications with ionic framework]


    - angularjs introduced by google.
      angular2 introduced by google and microsoft.


    - angularjs difficult in programming because of no coding standards.
      angular2 easy compared to angularjs.



    - in general we will prepare angularjs applications by using "javascript".
      in general we will prepare angular2 applications by using "typescript"
      [transpilation : converting the typescript to javascript called as transpilation]



    - angularjs have a poor performance compared to angular2.
      angular2 have a 5X more performance compared to angularjs.


    - we can run the angularjs applications locally
      we must dependent environmental setup provided vendor to run angular2 applications.



differences between angularjs - reactjs
---------------------------------------

    - angularjs is the framework (javascript framework)
      reactjs is the javascript library.

    -


    - angularjs recomended for data rendering on view(JSON)
      reactJS recomended for data structures manipulations (server side data rendering)































































































            Ex.

                function ctrl(){
                    var data = "data from database"
                }

                [Note : where ctrl called as controller in angularJS]

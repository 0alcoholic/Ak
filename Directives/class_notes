Directives:

    - Directives in angularjs, enhances the HTML Capabilities.

    - We have two types of directives.

        1.predefined directives

        2.custom directives

1.predefined directives
------------------------

    - The Directives given by the framework called as Predefined Directives.


1)ng-app
--------
    - this directive called as root directive.

    - angular framework starts the execution from ng-app directive.

    - "ng-app" directive takes the logical name of web application.

    - logical name of web application optional for
      static angular applications

    Ex.
        ng-app

    - logical name of web application mandatory for "dynamic angular applications"

      Ex.
        ng-app="app"

    - executing the angular application forcefully without "ng-app"
      directive called as "manual bootstrap".



2) ng-controller
    - this directive used to declare the controllers.

    - we can have more than one controller per web application.

    - in genaral we will declare controllers in view.

        Ex.

            <div ng-controller="ctrl_one">
                //Logic Goes Here
            </div>

    - in general we will implement the controllers in javascript.

        Ex.
            app.controller("ctrl_one",ctrl_one);
            function ctrl_one($scope){
                //Logic Goes Here
            }


3. ng-repeat

    - this directive used to iterate the list of elements from an array.

Syntax.
    ng-repeat = "variable in array" ng-bind="variable"


Predefined Objects with ng-repeat:
----------------------------------
1.$index
    - it will return the indexes of an elements from an array.

2.$first
    - it will return first index of an array as true.

3.$last
    - it will return last index of an array as true.

** 4.$middle
    - it will return all the middle indexes of an array as true.

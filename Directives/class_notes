- directives in angularjs enhances th html capabilities.

- we have two types of directives.

    1. predefined directives

    2. custom directives

predefined directives:

    - the directives given by the framework called as predefined directives.

1. ng-app
    - this directive called as root directive.
    - angular framework starts the execution from ng-app directive.
    - ng-app directive takes the logical name of web application
    - logical name of web application optional for "static angular applications"
    - logical name of web application mandatory for "dynamic web application"
    - we can have only one "ng-app" directive per web application

manual bootstrap:
    - executing angular application forcefully without ng-app directive called as manual bootstrap.

- the code which is out of "ng-app" directive won't executes by angular framework.


2. ng-controller

    - in angular applications we can declare the controllers ny using "ng-controller" directive.
    - we can have more than one controller per web application.
    - in genaral we will declare the controllers in view
        Ex.
            <div ng-controller="ctrl">
                //Code
            </div>
    - in general we will implement the controllers by using javascript.
        Ex.
            app.controller("ctrl" , ctrl);
            function ctrl($scope){
                //Logic
            }

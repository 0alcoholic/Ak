Directives:
    - Directives in angularjs, used to enhances the html capabilities.

    - we have to types of directives.

        1. predefined directives

        2. custom directives


predefined directives:
    - the directives given by the angular framework called as predefined directives.

    Ex.
        ng-app
        ng-model
        ng-bind
        ng-repeat
        --
        --
        --

1.ng-controller

    - this directive used to declare the controllers.

    - in general we will declare the controllers in view.

        Ex.
            <div ng-controller="ctrl">

            </div>

    - in genaral we will implement controllers in javascript

        Ex.
            app.controller("ctrl",ctrl);
            function ctrl($scope){
                //Logic
            }

    - in general we can take more than one controller per web application.

2. ng-click

    - when ever we click the user interface elements , automatically ng-click directive executed by
      angular framework.

Syntax.
    ng-click = "Expression" /
                "user defined function"/
                "user defined function with parameters"

Ex.
    ng-click="count=count+1"

    ng-click = "login()"

    ng-click="login('admin','admin')"


3. ng-init
     - this directive used to initilize the the variable.
     - we can initilize the variables in the form of a "key&value" pairs.
     - ng-init variables scope is "application scope"

            db_password='root'"


4. ng-options
    - this directive used to populate the values to the dropdown.

Syntax.
    ng-options="model_values as dropdown_values for variable in array"


    $scope.array = [
        {'s_code':1,'s_name':'AngularJS'},
        {'s_code':2,'s_name':'Angular4'},
        {'s_code':3,'s_name':'reactJS'},
        {'s_code':4,'s_name':'nodeJS'},
        {'s_code':5,'s_name':'Kotlin'}
    ];

    Use Case : 1

        dropdown --> s_name
        model    --> s_code

    <select ng-model="model_one"
            ng-options="x.s_code as x.s_name for x in array"></select>

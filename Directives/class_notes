Directives:

    - Directives in angularjs, enhances the HTML Capabilities.

    - We have two types of directives.

        1.predefined directives

        2.custom directives

1.predefined directives
------------------------

    - The Directives given by the framework called as Predefined Directives.


1)ng-app
--------
    - this directive called as root directive.

    - angular framework starts the execution from ng-app directive.

    - "ng-app" directive takes the logical name of web application.

    - logical name of web application optional for
      static angular applications

    Ex.
        ng-app

    - logical name of web application mandatory for "dynamic angular applications"

      Ex.
        ng-app="app"

    - executing the angular application forcefully without "ng-app"
      directive called as "manual bootstrap".



2) ng-controller
    - this directive used to declare the controllers.

    - we can have more than one controller per web application.

    - in genaral we will declare controllers in view.

        Ex.

            <div ng-controller="ctrl_one">
                //Logic Goes Here
            </div>

    - in general we will implement the controllers in javascript.

        Ex.
            app.controller("ctrl_one",ctrl_one);
            function ctrl_one($scope){
                //Logic Goes Here
            }


3. ng-repeat

    - this directive used to iterate the list of elements from an array.

Syntax.
    ng-repeat = "variable in array" ng-bind="variable"


Predefined Objects with ng-repeat:
----------------------------------
1.$index
    - it will return the indexes of an elements from an array.

2.$first
    - it will return first index of an array as true.

3.$last
    - it will return last index of an array as true.

** 4.$middle
    - it will return all the middle indexes of an array as true.

5.$even
    - it will return even indexes of an array as true.

6.$odd
    - it will return odd indexes of an array as true.


4. ng-click
------------
    - when ever we click the user interface elements, automatically
      ng-click directive will be executed by angular framework.


Syntax.
    ng-click= "Expression"/
              "user defined function"/
              "user defined function with parameters"

Example:

    ng-click="count=count+1"

    ng-click="login()"

    ng-click="login('admin','admin')"



5)ng-options
    - this directive used to populate the values to the drop down.

Syntax.
    ng-options = "model_values as dropdown_values for variable in array"

Ex.
    $scope.array_one = [{'p_id':1,'p_name':'laptop'},
                        {'p_id':2,'p_name':'tv'},
                        {'p_id':3,'p_name':'mac book'},
                        {'p_id':4,'p_name':'smart phone'},
                        {'p_id':5,'p_name':'watch'}];

    Use Case : 1
        drop down - id's
        model     - names

    <select ng-model="model_one" ng-options="x.p_name as x.p_id for
                                             x in array_one"></select>


    Use Case : 2
        drop down - names
        model     - id's

    <select ng-model="model_two" ng-options="x.p_id as x.p_name for
                                             x in array_one"></select>



    Use Case : 3
        drop down - names
        model     - names


    Use Case : 4
        drop down - id's
        model     - id's


    Ex.

        $scope.array_two = ["Hello_1","Hello_2","Hello_3","Hello_4","Hello_5"];
        drop down - Hello_1 to Hello_5
        model     - Hello_1 to Hello_5
        <select ng-model="model_five" ng-options="x as x for x in array_two"></select>



6.ng-init
    - ng-init directive used to initilize the members in configuration phase.
    - ng-init initilized members available to application scope.
    - we can declare the members in the form of a "key&value" pairs.

Syntax.
    ng-init="db_user = 'root'"

where "db_user" is the key and we can access anywhere in the application.


7. ng-dblclick:
    - this directive will execute by angular framework when ever double click
      event raised by user interface elements

Syntax.
    ng-dblclick="Expression"/
                "user defined function"/
                "user defined function with parameters"

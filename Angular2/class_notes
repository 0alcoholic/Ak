 - Angular2 mainly for "web application" as well as "mobile application" development.

 - In general we can develop angular2 applications by using "TypeScript".

 - "TypeScript" is the programming language interduced by "MicroSoft".

 - In general browsers may not understand TypeScript so we need to convert
   "TypeScript" to "JavaScript" by using "tsc" compiler.

 - Converting the "TypeScript" to "JavaScript" called as transpilation.

 - In general we can develop angular2 applications by using "environment"
   provided by microsoft.

 - By using Angular2 we can develop only dynamic Applications.

---------------------------------------------

Basic_App

    package.json

    systemjs.config.js

    tsconfig.js

    src

        index.html

        app.component.ts

        main.ts

package.json
------------
   - this configuration file used to download the required dependencies
     to develop angular2 application


systemjs.config.js
------------------
    - this file we can call loader in angular2.

    - angular2 loader will load all the required dependencies in perticular
      order.

        sub_three;
        AppComponent(){
            this.sub_one = "Angular2";
            this.sub_two = "NodeJS";
            this.sub_three = "MongoDB";
        }
    }

Storages.

    - AngularJS Provides Two Types Of Storages.

    1.localStorage
    2.sessionStorage

    localStorage. As a Developer we must destory / delete the localStorage Programatically.

    sessionStorage. When ever we "close the browser" / "Opens the New Tab" Automatically data will be lost
                    in sessionStorage.

    - ngStorage is the Predefined Module used to work with the Storages

    - ngStorage Module Provides Two Predefined Objects.

    1.$localStorage
    2.$sessionStorage


    $localStorage - used to work with the localStorage.

    $sessionStorage - used to work with the sessionStorage.


    - we can store the data in the form of a key&value pairs.


 Ex.

    $localStorage.key1={'uname':'admin','upwd':'admin'};  // Storing the Data into localStorage

    var obj = $localStorage.key1;                        // Reading the Data From localStorage

    console.log(obj.uname+"...."+obj.upwd);

    delete $localStorage.key1;                           // Deleting the data from localStorage




        $sessionStorage.key1={'uname':'admin','upwd':'admin'};  // Storing the Data into sessionStorage

        var obj = $sessionStorage.key1;                        // Reading the Data From sessionStorage

        console.log(obj.uname+"...."+obj.upwd);

        delete $sessionStorage.key1;                           // Deleting the data from sessionStorage

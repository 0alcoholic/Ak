    - Services are used to share the common business logic to controllers.

    - by using services we can achieve the re usability.

    - we have two types of services.

        1.Predefined Services

        2.Custom Services

Custom Services.

    Creating our own services called as Custom Services.

    In AngularJS we can create Custom Services in 5 ways.

1.provider()
2.factory()
3.value()
4.constant()
5.service()


Creating the Custom Service By using provider().
    - Provider() will dependent on $get() predefined function to provide
services to the controllers.


Ex.

app.config(config);
config.$inject=["my_serviceProvider"];
function my_serviceProvider(){
     my_serviceProvider.db_password="root_two";
}


app.provider("my_service",my_service);
function my_service(){
    this.db_password="root_one";
    this.$get = function(){
        return this.db_password;
    }
}


app.controller("ctrl_one",ctrl_one);
ctrl_one.$inject=["$scope",my_service];
function ctrl_one($scope,my_service){
    $scope.var_one = my_service;
}



app.controller("ctrl_two",ctrl_two);
ctrl_two.$inject=["$scope",my_service];
function ctrl_two($scope,my_service){
    $scope.var_two = my_service;
}

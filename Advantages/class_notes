Advantages.

1. As a Angular Developer We Can Directly Work with the HTML DOM.

    DOM Stands for Document Object Model


Ex.

    Copy the Data From One "Div" to Another "Div" by using HTML & JavaScript.


index.html
-
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <div id="div_one">Hello</div>
    <div id="div_two"></div>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML =
        document.getElementById("div_one").value;
    </script>
</html>

[Note. We Can Work with the DOM By using JavaScript ]

Copy the Data From One Div to Another Div By Using AngularJS.
-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>
    <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>
    <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>

[Note. By Using Angular Directives we can directly work with the HTML DOM]



2. AngularJS Reduces the Burden on the Server.
    - We Can implement the Business Components at the Client Side by using MVC.


3. Angular Applications are Cross Browser Compatable Applications.


4. AngularJS Supports the Two Way Data Binding.

    Automatic data synchronization between model and view with the supervision of controller called as Two Way Data Binding.


5. We Can Create the SPA

    SPA Stands for Single Page Applications


Disadvantages Of AngularJS.


1. Secuirity.

    - We are Missing the Secuirity because we are implementing the Business Components at client side.


2. Client Should Enable the JavaScript.


3. No Coding Standards

    - Understanding the Angular Applications are Difficult , because of no coding standards.

Custom Directives.
    - Creating Our Own Directive called as Custom Directives.

    - In AngularJS , we can use the Custom Directives in 3 ways.

        1. As an Element
        2. As an CSS Class
        3. As an Attribute

    Ex.
        my_directive

    <my_directive></my_directive> // Element
    <div class="my_directive"></div> //CSS Class
    <div my_directive></div> //Attribute
